      To meet this challenge you build a "machine" that consisted of a
      20-meter cube of golf balls (thus (20 x 10)^3 = 8 million
      liters, for ~100 million balls, corresponding to the number of
      playouts considered by a typical Monte Carlo tree search) with

So you put your cube o' balls at the tee, and set the charge off.

Assuming the charge is symmetrical and calibrated for a par-5 hole,
the 100 million balls will be scattered over a 500m radius circle,
with an area of &pi; r^2 = about one million square meters, so there
will be about 100 per square meter.

bq. "A fixed wing aircraft with the parameters (surface area, mass, etc.) of a bumble bee could not fly" --  Ludwig Prandtl, paraphrased, circa 1930
~
bq. The wings [...] are moved almost horizontally during hovering [...] and there are three unusual phases in the wing stroke: the clap, the fling and the flip. In the clap the wings are brought together at the top of the morphological upstroke. In the fling [...] the opposed wings are flung open like a book, hinging about their posterior margins. In the flip [...] the wings are rapidly twisted through about 180Â°. -- Torkel Weis-Fogh

http://jeb.biologists.org/content/59/1/169.short
~
bq. Resolved computation of two dimensional insect hovering shows for the first time that a two dimensional hovering motion can generate enough lift to support a typical insect weight. The computation reveals a two dimensional mechanism of creating a downward dipole jet of counterrotating vortices, which are formed from leading and trailing edge vortices. -- Z. Jane Wang

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
h1. So what's going on here?

h3. Why does it even seem to work, in the narrow sense of beating humans?
   
The fact that people can learn to play go at all means that there are
Likely basic modules being engaged (map making, yours vs. mine, escape
vs. capture, estimating completion times, etc.)  These would be REALLY
GOOD TO LEARN ABOUT.

There must be some structure that we aren't seeing.  One way to find
the structure: do the Monte Carlo search, or even an exhaustive search
on smaller cases, and then do it again with a small change to the
original state.  Build up sets of cases in this way where making a
small change changes the answer (or perhaps cases where it doesn't)
and then look for patterns in them.  Does shifting everything change
the answer?  Shifting by an even number of positions?  Rotating 90
degrees?  Making changes inside settled territory?  But we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

<blockquote style='background:white; margin:80px; padding:40px;'>
  For the brain, or in creatures without a brain that which
  corresponds to it, is of all parts of the body the
  coolest. Therefore, as moisture turned into vapour by the sunâs heat
  is, when it has ascended to the upper regions, cooled by the
  coldness of the latter, and becoming condensed, is carried
  downwards, and turned into water once more; just so the
  excrementitious evaporation, when carried up by the heat to the
  region of the brain, is condensed into a âphlegmâ (which explains
  why catarrhs are seen to proceed from the head); while that
  evaporation which is nutrient and not unwholesome, becoming
  condensed, descends and cools the hot. The tenuity or narrowness of
  the veins about the brain itself contributes to its being kept cool,
  and to its not readily admitting the evaporation. This, then, is a
  sufficient explanation of the cooling which takes place, despite the
  fact that the evaporation is exceedingly hot.

  - "...but the thingamabob that does the job..."
  - java hello world (lots of padding)
  - C hello world (wc of main & all headers)
  - ruby hello world (don't see a lot of salama-goo here)
  - look at runtimes though -- padding stripped from syntax, but shows up in runtime
  - 
  -    (bridge content here)
  -
  - most "AI" software is >99.9% salamago, because we want to understand it.
  - the situation is reversed doing things we understand well enough to build hardware
    for (almost universally, these are things we don't have mental modules for, and
    thus had to solve).  Adding integers, for example is far more efficient with a
    computer (which has math hardware) instead of in your head (where you have to
    work through the algorithm "by hand")
  - The phrase is revieling.  You do it using your internal hand-eye action simulator,
    as if you were doing it on paper.  To see this, first add

         137
       + 282
      ------   
         
    Then:

         CXXXVII
      + CCLXXXII
    ------------

    It feels like a very different problem, because in the roman numeral case you're grouping objects:


         C     XXX  V  II
      + CC  L  XXX     II
     -------------------
       CCC L XXXXXX V IIII
       CCC LL     X V IIII
       CCCC X V IIII
       CCCC X IX

  - Neither of these is much like what goes on when a CPU adds two numbers.  Because we understand it, we can build efficient hardware to do it.
